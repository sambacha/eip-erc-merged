## Abstract

Extend [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) to support `tokenName` in type `string` and be able to convert with `tokenId`.

## Motivation

For Marketplaces, Explorers, Wallets, DeFi and dApps to better display and operate NFTs that comes with a name.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

1. All compliant contracts MUST implement the following interfaces: `IERC_NamedTokenCore`

```solidity`
interface IERC_NamedTokenCore {
  function idToName(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (string);
  function nameToId(string memory _tokenName) external returns (uint256);
}
```

2. Compliant [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) contracts MUST implmenet the following interfaces: `IERCNamedNFT`

```solidity
interface IERCNamedNFT {
  function safeTransferFromByName(string memory _tokenName, address from, address to, bytes calldata);
  function approveByName(address _approved, string memory _tokenName) external payable;

  function getApprovedByName(string memory _tokenName) external view returns (address);
}
```

3. All method involving `tokenId` for a compliant contract IS RECOMMENDED to have a counterpart method end with `ByName` that substitute all pamameters of `uint256 tokenId` with `string memory name`.

<!-- TODO add `ERC-1155` and other id-based token. -->

## Rationale

We extend both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 because of their wide adoption. We also recommend a way to extend other ID based token standard because we believe there will be future use case.

## Backwards Compatibility

This is designed to be backward compatible with ERC-721.

## Security Considerations

Contract developer shall declare normalization mechanism.
